# Kotlin Visio Solution

A modern video conferencing solution developed in Kotlin, designed to offer seamless integration between web services, video communication, and user API.

## ‚ú® Main Features

- üìπ Real-time video conferencing
- üë• User management
- ...

## üì¶ User API

Instantiate the API to access the sub-objects

```kotlin
val api = Api(
  "http://localhost:8071/api/v1.0",
  enableHttpLogs = true
) { "my meet_sessionid session cookie" }
```

From there, access the various ressources via the getters and their methods

## üîê Test Configuration

To enable the tests, you will need to do the following steps

### √âtapes pour lancer les tests :

1. Log in to the platform's web interface.
2. Open developer tools (F12) > "Storage" tab > "Cookies".
3. Copy the value of the `sessionid` cookie.
4. Add this value to your `~/.gradle/gradle.properties` file under the following key:

```properties
VOPENIA_MEET_TESTS_COOKIE_TOKEN_VALUE=your_meet_sessionid_cookie_value
```

5. Run the tests with Gradle using the JVM platform: _currently the other platforms will likely fail given the backend's certificate_

```bash
./gradlew test
```

## üöÄ Install the Project

To run the application locally:

```bash
./gradlew publishToMavenLocal
```

## Tests on mobile devices

In order to test on mobile devices :

- create a tunnel to the ::3071 endpoint
- configure a tunnel to the 8181 port -> which will be used to give you the credentials
- configure your ~/.gradle/gradle.properties

```
VOPENIA_MEET_TESTS_TUNNEL_ENDPOINT=https://ngrok.endpoint.for.8181
VOPENIA_MEET_TESTS_TUNNEL_API=https://ngrok.endpoint.for.3071
```

### Testing on iOS

Edit the gradle.properties file, put at the end:
```
iOSSimulatorUuid=4BB42133-F542...
```

You can get the list of devices via `xcrun xctrace list devices`.

Running the iosSimulatorArm64Test will now open the simulator and run the tests

```bash
./gradlew :kotlin-meet-sdk-api:iosSimulatorArm64Test
```
